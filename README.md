#PLANNER.DEV

This repo contains two projects continuously worked on during my time as a Codeup student.

1) Todo List
- This application is a web-based version of a todo list. A user can add/remove individual tasks, import a list of tasks, and save the list to a file.

2) Address Book
- This application is a web-based address book. User can add/remove individual contacts, import a csv file of contacts, and export contacts into a csv file.
